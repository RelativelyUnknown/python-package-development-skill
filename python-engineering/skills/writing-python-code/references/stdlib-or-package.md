# Standard library or a package

Examples and a rule, not a boundary. A package for a few lines is as wrong as a hand-rolled parser for a hard format. Decide in this order.

1. **The project's own idiom first.** If its code already validates, parses, retries or serialises with a library, use that for new code. Do not add a second mechanism, and do not rewrite working code to switch. A project with pydantic models gets a pydantic model; a project without pydantic does not get it for one function.
2. **Stay in the standard library while the job is small**: roughly under 15 lines, one or two call sites, and none of the hard parts (security, time zones, text formats, network protocols).
3. **A package earns its place** when at least one holds:
   - the job is hard to get right and mistakes are subtle or costly (password hashing, tokens, HTML sanitising, time zones and recurrence, free-form dates, XML from untrusted sources, HTTP with retries and pooling);
   - the same job repeats at three or more places, so one shared mechanism removes more code than it adds;
   - it is the ecosystem standard readers expect (pytest, ruff, httpx for async HTTP);
   - it replaces more code than it adds, counting the tests the hand-rolled version would need.
4. **Weigh the cost.** A dev-only dependency costs users nothing; a runtime one does. A library's dependencies become its users', so keep the base install small and put heavy ones in extras; an application or a single-file script may take more (`# /// script` metadata, PEP 723, declares a script's dependencies inline). Also count install size, import time, transitive packages, licence and maintenance health (see `auditing-python-dependencies`).
5. **Say so when you add one**, with the reason from step 3.

## Validation ladder

| Situation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| One function, one to three arguments | `if not ...: raise ValueError(f"unknown region {region!r}; expected one of {sorted(REGIONS)}")` in the function |
| A few related records you construct yourself | a frozen dataclass with `__post_init__` checks |
| Untrusted nested JSON, many models, coercion, error lists, schema output | pydantic, or the validator the project already uses |
| A config file | `tomllib` and a dataclass |
| Command-line arguments | argparse `type=` and `choices=` |

## Common jobs

| Job | Standard library | Use a package when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP | `urllib.request` for one GET in a script, with `timeout=` | retries, pooling, async, HTTP/2: httpx or requests, with `raise_for_status()` |
| HTTP retries | a loop with a cap, backoff and a named exception | several call sites, or jitter: `tenacity`, `urllib3.util.Retry` via `HTTPAdapter`, httpx `HTTPTransport(retries=...)` for connection errors |
| URLs | `urllib.parse`, or the client's `params=` | never string concatenation |
| Dates and times | `datetime.fromisoformat` (3.11+ parses `Z`), `strptime` for known formats, `zoneinfo` | free-form text or recurrence: `dateparser`, `python-dateutil` |
| Paths and files | `pathlib`, `tempfile`, `shutil` | |
| Subprocesses | `subprocess.run(..., check=True, timeout=...)`, `shlex` | |
| CLI | `argparse` | many subcommands, completion, or the project already uses click or typer |
| Data formats | `json`, `csv`, `html.parser`, `packaging.version`, `tomllib` | YAML, untrusted XML (`defusedxml`), scraping HTML (`beautifulsoup4`); never `line.split(",")` |
| Collections | `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `itertools`, `itertools.batched` (3.12+; older: an `islice` loop) | |
| Caching | `functools.cache` | expiry, size limits or sharing across processes: `cachetools` or an external cache |
| Concurrency | `concurrent.futures`; `asyncio.TaskGroup`, `asyncio.timeout` (3.11+) | |
| Tokens and IDs | `secrets`, `uuid`; never `random` for anything security-related | |
| Passwords, encryption | nothing; never write your own | `argon2-cffi`, `bcrypt`, `cryptography` |
| Test doubles | `tmp_path`, `monkeypatch`, `unittest.mock` | dev dependencies are cheap: `time-machine`, `responses`, `respx` |

Quoting for a shell, JSON or CSV uses `shlex.quote`, `json.dumps` or `csv`, never hand-rolled escaping. Entries marked 3.11+ or 3.12+ follow the table in `python-versions.md`.
