# Style guide

Defaults distilled from the Google developer documentation style guide, the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, the Python devguide documentation style guide and Write the Docs. A project's own style guide wins over this file.

## Grammar and voice

- Second person; present tense; active voice. Passive is fine when the actor is unknown or irrelevant ("The file is deleted after 30 days").
- Imperative mood for instructions; indicative for descriptions.
- Contractions are fine in conversational docs (Microsoft, Google) and avoided in formal reference. Pick one per docs set.
- American spelling by default (Google, Microsoft, Python devguide examples); follow the project if it uses another variety.
- Use the serial (Oxford) comma.

## Headings and titles

- Sentence case: capitalize the first word and proper nouns only.
- Task pages and sections: bare imperative verb ("Install the CLI"); conceptual pages: noun phrase ("Authentication model"); reference: the object's name.
- No punctuation at the end, no code-only headings where a phrase works, no emoji, no "Introduction" as the only first heading.
- Do not skip levels; one H1 per page.

## Lists and procedures

- Numbered list for steps that happen in order; bullets otherwise.
- One action per step. Start the step with the verb, or with the condition or location if there is one ("In `config.toml`, set ...").
- State the result after the step when the reader must check it before going on.
- Introduce a list with a complete sentence or a fragment ending in a colon; keep items parallel.
- A procedure has at most about ten steps; split longer ones into sub-procedures with their own headings.
- Optional steps start with "Optional:".

## Punctuation and capitalization

- One space after a full stop. No exclamation marks.
- Em dashes sparingly; prefer commas, colons or separate sentences.
- Capitalize product and feature names exactly as their owners do (Python, PyPI, GitHub, macOS). Generic terms stay lowercase (the command line, the server).
- Write "Python", "Unicode", "POSIX" capitalized; "reST" with a lowercase r; "free-threaded" rather than "no-GIL" (Python devguide).

## Numbers, dates and units

- Numerals for numbers 10 and up and for any measurement; spell out one to nine in prose.
- Units with a space: `500 ms`, `16 GB`. Use the unit symbol consistently.
- Unambiguous dates: `2026-11-03` in technical text, or "November 3, 2026" in prose; never `11/03/26`.
- Time zones explicit (UTC). Ranges with "to" in prose ("3 to 5 retries").

## Code, UI and file names

- Code font: code, commands, flags, parameters, return values, environment variables, file and directory names, literal values (`true`, `None`, `"utf-8"`).
- Bold: UI elements the reader clicks or reads (**Save**, **Settings**). Do not put UI names in quotes.
- Placeholders in angle brackets and uppercase or descriptive (`<PROJECT_ID>`), defined right after the example.
- Do not use code font as emphasis, or a code term as an English verb ("`git push` the branch"); write "push the branch with `git push`".

## Notes and warnings

- Use admonitions rarely; when everything is a note, nothing is.
- Note: helpful but skippable. Important: needed for success. Warning or caution: risk of data loss, security exposure or a crash; say what happens and how to avoid it.
- Never put essential steps only inside a note.

## Accessibility and inclusive language

- Alt text says what an image shows and why it matters; decorative images get empty alt text.
- Do not rely on color, position ("the button on the right") or direction ("above", "below") alone.
- Avoid ableist and violent metaphors ("crippled", "kill" when "stop" works) where a plain word exists; keep technical terms that are the actual API (`kill -9`).
- Use "they" for an unspecified person. Write examples with diverse, realistic names, not stereotypes.
